# Use Case - My application provides whole HTML page (or its skeleton)

<div className="sb-unstyled">

Application needs to include font links in the `<head>` of its HTML page. This way the fonts are available for the content of the page (and SPAs included in it).

Examples of this use case are _Online_ and _AppShell_ with their page layouts. Also remember to use preconnect and preload links to create the most performant version, see snippet below.

```html focus=2:26
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="preconnect" crossorigin="anonymous" href="{fonts_cdn}" />

    <link
      rel="preload"
      as="style"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      href="{fonts_cdn}/fonts/v2/{font_name}.css"
    />
    <link
      rel="preload"
      as="font"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      href="{fonts_cdn}/fonts/v2/{font_name}.woff2"
    />
    <!-- Other preloaded font files -->

    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      href="{fonts_cdn}/fonts/v2/{font_name}.css"
      media="print"
      onload="this.media='all'"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    My App Content
  </body>
</html>
```

</div>
