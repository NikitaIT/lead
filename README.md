# Lead

## Dev

When a developer runs say `nx serve lead --devRemotes=ag-grid-shell --verbose`, they still run the whole application, but `auth` and `home` are served statically, from cache. As a result, the serve time and the time it takes to see the changes on the screen go down, often by an order of magnitude.

```sh
nx serve lead --devRemotes=ag-grid-shell --verbose
```

## How to up

```sh
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.override.yml docker-compose up -d
```

```sh
nx run auth-service:serve
nx run home-apis:serve
nx run getway-service:serve
```
